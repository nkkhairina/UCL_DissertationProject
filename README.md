This project is dedicated to the development and implementation of a robust recommender tool aimed at significantly enhancing career opportunities for graduates by aligning their acquired skills with suitable job roles using the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) dataset. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT), the project meticulously analyses the intricate relationships between graduates' specific skill sets and a diverse array of over 3,000 occupations catalogued in ESCO open-source data. 
The OccupationSkillRecommendation.ipynb notebook serves as the main notebook for this project
