This project is dedicated to the development and implementation of a robust recommender tool aimed at significantly enhancing career opportunities for graduates by aligning their acquired skills with suitable job roles using the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) dataset. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT), the project meticulously analyses the intricate relationships between graduates' specific skill sets and a diverse array of over 3,000 occupations catalogued in ESCO open-source data. Initial findings demonstrate Sentence BERT's superior accuracy in skill-occupation matching compared to TF-IDF, affirming the effectiveness of deep learning models in this context. Key components include thorough data preprocessing to align skills with relevant occupations and flatten ESCO's hierarchical structure. Despite geopolitical changes, ongoing UK-EU cooperation ensures ESCO's relevance in categorizing skills and occupations for UK graduates. Ultimately, this tool equips graduates with a clear understanding of career pathways, empowering confident navigation of the job market and facilitating smooth transitions from academia to professional life with tailored, actionable career guidance.
